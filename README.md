## Description

As full stack developers, we will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem. In creating our first collaborative full-stack application, we will combine a robust back end—with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authentication—to an intuitive front end. We will continue to build on the agile development methodologies that we've used in the past throughout this course, like storing project code in GitHub, managing work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.

Instead of using the front end developed for on our first project, we are going to start from scratch. Doing so will help us reinforce our existing front-end abilities and solidify understanding of the dynamic between the front end and back end. Also, we all have likely improved our skills since that first project, so with a stronger foundation now we are going to build a better application, using all of the additional practice from the last several weeks.

Now, as contributors to PROJECT GameList we will use everything that has been learned over the past six weeks to create a full-stack application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge. Even more than the first group project, this project will provide an opportunity to demonstrate problem-solving skills, which employers will want to see when you begin to interview for development roles. Once again, the user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that we will create, but the project must fulfill the following requirements:

## Project Requirements

```md
Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.

Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.

Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).

Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).

Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
```

## Presentation Requirements

```md
Elevator pitch: A one-minute description of your application.

Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

Demo: Show your stuff!

Directions for future development.

Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository. Use the Guide to Deploy with Heroku and MySQL Links to an external site.on The Full-Stack Blog if you need a reminder on how to deploy to Heroku.
```

## Installation

- git clone https gitHub Link (https://github.com/MartinCespedes/project-gamelist.git)

##

The packages required to run are:

- bcrypt

- connect-session-sequelize

- dotenv

- express

- express-handlebars

- express-session

- mysql2

- sequelize

A database will need to be created first then seeded wih data.
